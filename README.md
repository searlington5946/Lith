# Lith

## What is it?

"The man who moves a mountain begins by carrying away small stones."

Lith is short for lithic (or stone). It allows you to visualize your progress towards a goal by dividing a larger task into smaller tasks called liths.

## How do I use it?

1. Create a task by tapping "New" on the Main screen.
2. Give your task a name and the number of liths you'd like it to have. Tap "Create" to confirm.
3. Click a task to enter the Task View screen.
4. Modify the state of liths by turning them on and off. Tap "Save" to confirm.
5. The task will now reflect the number of completed liths on the Main screen as a ratio or percentage (depending on your settings).
6. Click the gear icon in the top right corner to configure your settings.
7. When you want to delete a task, enter the Task View screen and tap "Delete".
